I designed the framework to my desire, I have tried to create a simple, lightweight and an elegant object oriented design.
TODO:
    - Make form validation more elegant.
    - Database class should add args and table prefix not driver
    - Make framework more moduler
    - Try codeIgnighter and see if any features / methologies are worth implementing
