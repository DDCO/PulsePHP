I designed the framework to my desire, I have tried to create a simple, lightweight and an elegant object oriented design.
TODO:
    - Create view helpers (paginate)
    - Model be associated with database table? Make it optional?
    - Make form validation more elegant.
    - Database class should add args and table prefix not driver
